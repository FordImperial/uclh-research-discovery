## Data

Data should be available to download as csv files on this page, but once the UCL RDR approves the release, it will also be accessible via the widget here.

Representative data files have been generated column by column via random draw from the distribution of entries in the real data. Columns were selected manually for inclusion based on which could be modelled well. Refer to data_description.csv for a full list of fields used in the MS-PINPOINT project.
