### A public engagement site for UCLH research. 
Learn about the many different
research projects being carried out using patient data and how it is being
used to help improve patient care. Each project provides information
about the steps taken to protect sensitive patient data, as well as access 
to code written by the researchers and synthetic datasets to enable you to 
replicate their analyses.
